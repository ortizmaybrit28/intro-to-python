# A "heinous" example of arithmetic math problem is the following:
print((5*4*3*2*1)/(3*2*1)*5-12(10-9)/2+1)

# The answer should be 95
# Seemingly simple arithmetic problem requires PEMDAS
# I would see problems like this on the internet, it ALWAYS causes a stir
# Use PEDMAS and go left and right; one wrong move can be apocalyptic...

# File Name? pain-in-my-pemdas
# Well, PEMDAS can be a pain in the butt! (I don't have the best humor, but that's ok..)	

# What is the process to run this python file?
# cd intro-to-python/homework (This pathway takes me to the directory (homework).)
# do nano "pain-in-my-pemdas.py" (create a python file, and it is named pain-in-my-pemdas.py)
# Insert comments/print, save the file, and close it to return to the command line
# python3 pain-in-my-pemdas.py (this runs the python file.)
